Work to prove, disprove, and discuss the lexiconical and linguistic evolution of  Programming Languages to adhere and eventually support the dialectical patterns of "conversational speech"... 

At the end class, i reached the conclusion that the black and white binary predictions are flawed... i tnhink we are taking a third path -- spoken tongue is starting to follow programming formats, and vice versa.  Eventually, though, i do think theuy will meet.
