Bonus code -- an API! 

Not sure how it is now, but there was no JSON format parsing in VB.net, to push their failed "Active-XML" product.

In an MIS Assignment I was asked to use vb.net to pull in a large dataset.  Most students in the Info Systems Mgmt classes have no deep level programming training, and spent most of their time writing waterfall code to compile-note error in 

I had it in my mind to parse with XML, but the system set up to be our schema space only dealt with JSON -- so i wrote my own REST-ful API for vb.net!

Now while 10+ years of changes probably added a native version, (this was designed for 2.0 and below), it is a concise demponstration of the ability to write an API cross-language as needed.
