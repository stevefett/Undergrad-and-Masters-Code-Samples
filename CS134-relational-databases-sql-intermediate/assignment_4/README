Assignment 4 - Installation and config of mysql server


Notes: 

Due to Gaia Server downtime, personal mysql was installed on my own externally facing server,  After issuing root login:

mysql -u root -p ********
CREATE SCHEMA PAINT_STORE CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;

Once created, the new schema was selected

use PAINT_STORE;

Config complete, now a locally hosted mysql is used in all future transactions or DB management.
