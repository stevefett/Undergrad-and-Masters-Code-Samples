These are my assignments for developing an understanding via state and turing machines as to how computing evolved.  Bufferless (Stateless), Single buffer, and dual (Turing) buffer state management will be simulated in Prolog and other languages.

Objectives include abstraction of system memory hiearchies in the physical sense to hand drawn state machines... approaching different problems with LIFO and FIFO state storage, infinite state loop issues, etc.  

By minimizing number of states the program must be in, abstraction before coding can help create resource concious designs.
