These are my networking assignments to test hand-written ethernet/token ring drivers (My semester was Ethernet, thank goodness... wasnt a fan of the idea of working with coaxial token ring).  Final testing involve sustaining both UDP and TCP connection to a port long enough to replace on govt tv, radio, and streamss for as long as possible.   Replacement transmission content is unknown, so algorithns must be REST-like, agnostic to content.
